# Gemini CLI Agent Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for the Gemini CLI agent when interacting with this Ansible repository.

Anytime I give you a new task to do, use ansible to do it. Always.

## Feature Addition Process:
1.  **Understand Request:** Analyze the user's request for a new feature.
2.  **Plan Implementation:** Develop a plan for implementing the feature, including creating new roles, tasks, or modifying existing playbooks.
3.  **Implement Feature:** Use Ansible tools to create/modify files as per the plan. After you've done the changes, you do not need to run the notebook.
4.  **Update README.md and .gitignore:** After implementing a new feature, the `README.md` and `.gitignore`  file will be updated to reflect the changes and document the new role/feature.
