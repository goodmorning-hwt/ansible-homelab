3.  **Implement Feature:** Use Ansible tools to create/modify files as per the plan.
4.  **Update README.md:** After implementing a new feature, the `README.md` file will be updated to reflect the changes and document the new role/feature.
5.  **Commit and Push Changes:** All changes related to the new feature and `README.md` updates will be committed to the Git repository with a descriptive commit message and then pushed to the remote repository.
